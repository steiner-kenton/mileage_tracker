   ```

4. **Install Tesseract OCR:**
   - **macOS:** `brew install tesseract`
   - **Ubuntu/Debian:** `sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr`
   - **Windows:** Download from [GitHub](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)

5. **Configure secrets:**
   Create `.streamlit/secrets.toml`:
   ```toml
   [google]
   api_key = "YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY"

   [supabase]
   SUPABASE_URL = "YOUR_SUPABASE_URL"
   SUPABASE_API = "YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY"
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY = "YOUR_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY"
   ```

6. **Set up Supabase database:**
   Run the SQL schema in your Supabase project (see `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`)

7. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
